Demo for: Chip Font Library (includes Chinese Character Set) GB2312, ASCII - Interfacing with OLED 12864 Display using Arduino Platform

In this demo, I used GT23L32S4W Font Chip from Genitop (Datasheet can be found in the repo) to show Chinese characters on 0.96" OLED 12864 Display. Font Chip use SPI protocol for communication with Arduino UNO and the OLED use I2C protocol.
Font chip includes Chinese Character Set GB2312 as well as ASCII Character set, for both the character sets different font sizes can be chosen.

Chinese character set in GT23L32S4W font chip includes 6763+846 characters.

ASCII character set in GT23L32S4W font chip includes 96 characters only.
